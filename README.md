# Cosmic Incubator

The Cosmic Incubator creates a miniature universe that harvests unstable and unobtainable materials. Gameplay wise, it generates various ores, with a different set of results on each planet.

This is very much a test version, and is not balanced or complete yet. The plan is to make it part of my next planet.
